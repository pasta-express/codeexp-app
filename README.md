# WeShare

* :bulb: WeShare is an app for companies and venues with excess space that can be converted into work spaces, 
  and would like to lease them on a short term basis to offset rental costs.  <br>
* :office_worker: WeShare is also an app for white collar workers seeking an alternative physical work environment, for reasons such as
  * Unavailable office as company does not rent office space.
  * Unconducive environment for remote working at home.
  * Craving a fresh environment.

### Problems addressed:

* With remote working increasingly becoming the norm, businesses can convert excess unused space into extra income.
* Workers previously priced out of a co-working space are able to choose where they want to work from. 
* **Goal** To efficiently manage the demand and supply of working spaces
